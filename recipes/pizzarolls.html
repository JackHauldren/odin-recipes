  9         <h2>Description</h2>
 10         <p>Pizza Rolls that are quick, dirty, and more importantly, require no culinary skills. Pillsbury approved.</p>
 11         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 12         <ul>
 13             <li>Pillsbury flaky cresent rolls.  Get the big tube.  Or offbrand, I'm not your dad.</li>
 14             <li>Any cheese you prefer.  I recommend pepperjack and mozzeralla.</li>
 15             <li>Pepperoni</li>
                <li>Optionally, marinara sauce</li>
 16          </ul>
 17          <h2>Steps</h2>
 18          <ol>
 19             <li>Break open your crescent roll tube and seperate pieces</li>
 20             <li>These rolls will be filled, so stretch them out into larger triangles</li>
 21             <li>Put your toppings on the bottom of the side you'd roll if these were normal crescent rolls.  I recommend Cheese-Pep-Cheese-Pep</li>
 22             <li>Roll it up like a normal crescent roll, being careful not to split the crust<li>
 23             <li>Tuck corners into edges. Avoid having any openings in your cholesteral lump, you don't want melted cheese all over your pan/oven</li>
 24             <li>Remember you need to preheat the oven. Curse yourself for not doing it before step 1. We're going to use whatever heat is on the tube</li>
 25             <li>Grease your pan, put your pizza rolls on pan. Stick in oven for time recommended on tube.  Even though they're larger, the default time is fine</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
